<p>Here comes a comet... Oh, sorry, a comment—brief but enlightening. So, what exactly are those comments and what do we need them for? Well, essentially, that's what we call a special text that will be ignored by the compiler. Comments allow you to clarify a piece of code or exclude it from the compilation process (that is, disable it). Throughout this course, we will use comments to explain how and why our code works.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of comments in Kotlin. Let's take a look at them.</p>
<h5 id="end-of-line-comments">End-of-line comments</h5>
<p>After "//", the compiler ignores any remaining text on the line.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    // The line below will be ignored
    // println("Hello, World")

    // This prints the string "Hello, Kotlin"
    println("Hello, Kotlin")  // Here can be any comment
    /// Valid single-line comment
}</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> In most code editors, a line can be commented by placing the caret on the line and pressing <code class="language-kotlin">Ctrl /</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">cmd /</code>.</p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="multi-line-comments">Multi-line comments</h5>
<p>The compiler ignores any text between the <code class="language-kotlin">/*</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">*/</code> symbols. You can use them for writing both single-line and multiple-line comments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    /* This is a single-line comment */
    /*  This is an example of
        a multi-line comment */

    /*** Valid multiline comment
        println("Hello")
        println("World")
    **/
}</code></pre>
<p>You can also put comments inside other comments. When writing nested <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4406" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a multi-line comment, also known as a documentation comment or doc comment, is used to document the code and generate API documentation. | These comments are written in a specific format, starting with `/**` and ending with `*/`, and can include markdown for formatting. They are written directly above the declaration of a class, method, or function that needs to be documented. The purpose of doc comments is to provide a detailed explanation of the code, making it easier for others to understand its functionality.">multi-line comments</a>, make sure the opening <code class="language-kotlin">/*</code> and the closing <code class="language-kotlin">*/</code> signs make pairs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    /*
    System.out.println("Hello")  // print "Hello"
    System.out.println("Kotlin") /* print "Kotlin" */
    */
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="documentation-comments-doc-comments">Documentation comments (doc comments)</h5>
<p>The compiler ignores any text between the <code class="language-kotlin">/**</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">*/</code> signs just like it ignores all text in multi-line comments. These kinds of comments are called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4406" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a documentation comment, also known as a KDoc comment, is a type of comment used to document the code and generate API documentation. | These comments are written in a specific format, starting with `/**` and ending with `*/`, and can include markdown for formatting.

Documentation is a text that helps others understand what your code does.

Kdoc supports various block tags such as `@param` for documenting parameters, `@return` for documenting return values, `@constructor` for documenting constructors, and many more. These comments, written in Markdown, are used to generate HTML documentation that can be used by other developers to understand the code. Dokka is a documentation generator for Kotlin, similar to Javadoc for Java, that generates API documentation from comments in the source code.">generate documentation</a> about your source code using a special tool.</p>
<p>Usually, these comments are placed above the declarations of respective program elements.

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>We've briefly discussed several kinds of comments you can insert in your code. Use them wisely and remember that numerous comments do not always make your program absolutely clear. The code may change, and the comments will become outdated. To reduce the number of comments, you should write self-documenting code, which might not be that simple for beginners. We will learn how to do it during the course.</p>
