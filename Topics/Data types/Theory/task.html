<h5 id="what-is-a-data-type" style="text-align: center;">What is a data type?</h5>
<p>All of us know that a number and a piece of text are pretty different. How do we know this? Well, you can perform <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations performed on numerical values using specific operators. | There are five arithmetic operators in Kotlin: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulo (%). These operators are binary, meaning they take two operands, which are the values or variables the operator is being applied to. For example, in the expression 1 + 3, 1 and 3 are the operands, and + is the operator. Arithmetic operations in Kotlin follow specific rules, such as multiplication having a higher priority than addition or subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and simplify notation. Additionally, Kotlin supports compound assignment operations that combine arithmetic operations and assignment, such as assignment after addition (a += b) and assignment after subtraction (a -= b).">arithmetic operations</a> (such as <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, multiplication is a binary arithmetic operation that involves multiplying two values. | It has a higher priority than addition or subtraction, meaning it is calculated first in an expression. For example, in the expression 3 + 5 \* 2, the multiplication is performed before the addition. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and simplify notation. Multiplication can be used in more complex expressions and can be combined with other arithmetic operations. Additionally, multiplication and division by two can be efficiently performed using bit-shift operators.">multiplication</a>) on numbers but not on texts. Kotlin also knows it. That's why every variable has a <strong>type</strong> that determines what possible operations you can perform on this variable and which values you can store in it.</p>
<h5 id="variable-types" style="text-align: center;">Variable types</h5>
<p>A variable's type is set when the variable is declared:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val text = "Hello, I am studying Kotlin now."
val n = 1</code></pre>
<p>In this case, Kotlin knows that <code class="language-kotlin">text</code> is a string and <code class="language-kotlin">n</code> is a number. Kotlin determines the types of both variables automatically. This mechanism is called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, type inference is the process where the compiler automatically deduces the data type of a variable, expression, or function parameter, without requiring explicit type declaration. | This feature is particularly useful in lambda expressions, where the parameter type is inferred from the interface, making the code easier to read. Kotlin's type inference works seamlessly with Java's functional interface, allowing for smooth interoperability between the two. Type inference helps to reduce redundancy in the code and makes it more concise, as the programmer does not have to explicitly specify the type of the variable every time.">type inference</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Please, take a look at the following piece of code. This is how we declare a variable with type inference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val/var identifier = initialization</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify the type of a variable when declaring it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val/var identifier: Type = initialization </code></pre>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"></span></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">Note, the type name always starts with an uppercase letter.<span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"></span></div>
<p></p>
<p>Let's declare the same variables as in the previous example and specify their types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val text: String = "Hello, I am studying Kotlin now."
val n: Int = 1</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code> type means that the variable stores an integer number (<code class="language-kotlin">0</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">1</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">2</code>, ..., <code class="language-kotlin">100_000_000</code>, ...). The <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> type means that the variable stores a string (<code class="language-kotlin">"Hello"</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">"John Smith"</code>). Later, you will learn more about these and other <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a data type is a classification that specifies the kind of value that a variable, expression, or function parameter can hold. | It is an essential aspect of a statically-typed language like Kotlin, which requires explicit or implicit type declarations for variables and function parameters. For instance, Kotlin has various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, and strings. Among these, strings are a widely-used data type that represents a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed by double quotes. Strings are often used in conditional statements and regular expressions, and they have various operations, such as getting the length or concatenating two strings. Moreover, type inference is a helpful feature in Kotlin that allows the compiler to deduce the data type of a variable, expression, or function parameter automatically, making the code more concise and readable.">data types</a>.</p>
<p>You will see that people use both these forms of variable declaration in practice. When you use type inference, you make your code more concise and readable, but in some cases, it may be better to specify the type. For example, if we need to declare a variable and initialize it later, type inference won't work at all.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val greeting // error
greeting = "hello"</code></pre>
<p>The example above is incorrect because Kotlin cannot infer the type of the variable when it is merely declared, while every variable must have a type. On the contrary, the example below does work because the type is specified by the programmer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val greeting: String // ok
greeting = "hello"</code></pre>
<h5 id="type-mismatch" style="text-align: center;">Type mismatch</h5>
<p>One of the most important functions of data types is to protect you from assigning an unsuitable value to a variable. Take a look at an example of code that doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val n: Int = "abc" // Type mismatch: inferred type is String but Int was expected</code></pre>
<p>So, if you see a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a type mismatch is an error that occurs when you try to assign a value of a different type to a variable, or when you try to assign an unsuitable value to a mutable variable declared with type inference. | The error message for a type mismatch usually includes the message type mismatch and specifies the expected and actual type. This error occurs when different types meet and type coercion is not possible, which is an automatic conversion of a value from one type to another that is wider in the type hierarchy, without any loss of information.">type mismatch</a></strong> error, it means you've assigned something unsuitable to a variable. The same problem occurs when you try to assign an unsuitable value to a mutable variable declared with type inference.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var age = 30 // the type is inferred as Int
age = "31 years old" // Type mismatch</code></pre>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"></span></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">Note, you cannot change the type of a variable.<span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal;"></span></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Later, we will learn about other data types and some problems associated with them. From now on, remember: once a variable is created, it has a type, and its type cannot be changed later.</p>
