<h5 id="writing-member-functions">Writing member functions</h5>
<p>Sometimes you need to store in objects not only the data itself but also a behavior. <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6364" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a member function is a function that is declared within a class and implements a common behavior for a set of objects that belong to the same class. | It is called a member function because it works with a specific object of a class and can access its fields.

<p>Member functions look like functions placed in the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6364" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class body refers to the section of a class declaration that contains the class members, such as properties, methods, and inner classes. | It is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and appears immediately following the class name and any visibility modifiers. The class body can be empty, as in the case of a marker interface, or it can contain a variety of member declarations.">class body</a>. In the example below, we declare a class with one function <code class="language-kotlin">print()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class MyClass {
    fun print() = println("Hello from print")
}</code></pre>
<p>This function is called a <strong>member</strong> function because it works with a specific object of a class and can access its fields. It's a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6364" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class member is a component that belongs to a class and can be either a property or a function. | Class members can be accessed and used within the class they belong to. When it comes to functions, member functions are functions that are defined within a class and can access the class's fields. They are also called methods and are used to implement a common behavior for a set of objects that belong to the same class. Class members can also be nested classes, which are classes defined within another class. Inner classes, a type of nested class, can access the members of their outer class, while regular nested classes cannot.">class member</a>:</p>

<p>As you may remember, the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6364" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include `fun` (used to define a function), `var` (used to define a variable), and `if` (used to define a conditional statement). Keywords are reserved words in Kotlin and cannot be used as identifiers.">keyword</a> <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> represents the current <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6364" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an instance refers to an object or an instance of a class that is created during runtime. | It is a subtype of every known type in Kotlin, meaning it can represent a value of any type in terms of type checking. This is particularly useful in situations where a function demands a return type, but it is impossible to return a value, such as when calculating a percentage if the value is zero. In such cases, a function that returns `Instance` can be used. The concept of instance is also related to threading, where only one thread can execute code in a synchronized method of a particular instance. This means that different threads can execute methods of different objects at the same time, a concept that can be summarized as one thread per instance.">instance</a> of the class. In the example above, it's an optional keyword, so you can omit it.</p>
<p>Just like functions, member functions can take arguments and return a value of any type including the same type as the defined class.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note, <u>member function</u> is Kotlin's <strong>official name</strong> of functions that are placed inside a class. Such functions are often called <u>methods</u>.</p></div>

<h5 id="calling-member-functions">Calling member functions</h5>
<p>Let's take a look at the example below. It prints the value of the field of the particular object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val myObject = MyClassWithProperty(10)
myObject.printProperty()  // prints "10"</code></pre>
<p>So to call a member function, you need to create an object of the class. Then, put a dot after the object name and write the function name with the arguments that you need in parentheses.</p>
<h5 id="an-example-with-cats">An example with cats</h5>
<p>As a more complex example, let's consider a class that represents a cat.</p>
<p>A cat can sleep. Also, a cat can make one of the two sounds: "meow" or "zzz". It depends on its state. Finally, a cat can be awakened.</p>
<p>Here we've added comments for class members. Read them to better understand the logic of the class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlin.random.Random // library for getting random numbers

class Cat(val name: String) {

    /** The current state of the cat (by default a cat isn't sleeping). */
    var sleeping: Boolean = false

    /**
     * A cat says "meow" if it is not sleeping, otherwise, it says "zzz".
     * After a cat says "meow", it can sometimes fall asleep.
     */
    fun say() {
        if (sleeping) {
            println("zzz")
        } else {
            println("meow")

            if (Random.nextDouble() &lt; 0.1) { //generates a double value between 0 and 1.0 
                sleeping = true
            }
        }
    }

    /** The function wakes the cat. */
    fun wakeUp() {
        sleeping = false
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can create an instance of a class and invoke its functions. Do not forget that a cat that you have just created is not sleeping.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val pharaoh = Cat("Pharaoh")  // Create a cat named "Pharaoh"

    repeat (5) {
        pharaoh.say()  // it says "meow" or "zzz"
    }

    pharaoh.wakeUp()  // wake the cat up
    pharaoh.say()  // it says "meow"
}</code></pre>
<p>The output of the program can be different because of <code class="language-kotlin">Random.nextDouble()</code> inside the <code class="language-kotlin">say</code> function. Here is an example of a possible output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">meow
meow
meow
zzz
zzz
meow</code></pre>
<p>So, member functions allow programmers to manipulate particular objects of a class and perform some operations. As always, functions unite a sequence of operations under a name that makes sense.</p>
