<p>You already know how to declare simple classes with simple properties. Now let's learn about another kind of a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class member is a component that belongs to a class and can be either a property or a function. | Class members can be accessed and used within the class they belong to. When it comes to functions, member functions are functions that are defined within a class and can access the class's fields. They are also called methods and are used to implement a common behavior for a set of objects that belong to the same class. Class members can also be nested classes, which are classes defined within another class. Inner classes, a type of nested class, can access the members of their outer class, while regular nested classes cannot.">class member</a>: constructors.</p>
<h5 id="default-constructor">Default constructor</h5>
<p><strong>Constructors </strong>are class members that initialize a new object of the class. In other words, constructors set a new object state by defining its properties. So, when you create an object, you invoke a constructor.</p>
<p>For further examples, let's use the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 1
    var height: Int = 1
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's remember for a second how to create objects. We write the class name and empty parentheses after it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size = Size()</code></pre>
<p>This is actually a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a constructor call is the process of creating an instance of a class by calling its constructor. | Every class in Kotlin must have a constructor to initialize its objects. If a constructor is not explicitly defined, an implicit default constructor with no arguments is provided by the compiler. This default constructor only creates an object without initializing its properties. When a constructor is called, it can receive arguments to initialize the properties of the object being created. The primary constructor is the most concise way to define a constructor and is used when some code needs to be executed during object creation. Initializer blocks can also be used along with constructors to execute code during object creation. Constructor calls are available for invocation under the class name and can take both default and named arguments.">constructor call</a></strong>, and it's like calling a function with no arguments. Every class needs to have a constructor, so if it isn't explicitly defined, the compiler automatically generates a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a primary constructor is a special type of constructor that is declared as part of the class header, after the class name. | It can have parameters that are used to initialize class properties directly or within an initializer block. The primary constructor cannot contain any code, but initialization code can be placed in initializer blocks. If a class requires more complex initialization that cannot be covered by the primary constructor, secondary constructors can be used. These secondary constructors must delegate to the primary constructor either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor.">primary constructor</a> without arguments</strong>, which only creates an object and doesn't have any logic inside.</p>
<h5 id="primary-constructor">Primary constructor</h5>
<p>Often you know the object's properties before you create it. To make your code more concise, you can set the properties in the constructor: just make the constructor receive the arguments you need.</p>
<p>The <strong>primary constructor</strong> is the right tool for that. It does not contain any code, it just initializes an instance of a class and its properties. To define a primary constructor, you should put class initialization arguments in the parentheses after the class name.</p>
<p>The primary constructor for the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(width: Int, height: Int) {
    val width: Int = width
    val height: Int = height
    val area: Int = width * height
}</code></pre>
<p>Usually, to define a constructor, you should put the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include `fun` (used to define a function), `var` (used to define a variable), and `if` (used to define a conditional statement). Keywords are reserved words in Kotlin and cannot be used as identifiers.">keyword</a> <code class="language-kotlin">constructor</code> before its parameters. Kotlin's primary constructor allows you to omit the keyword.</p>
<p>In any way, another legitimate way to define the primary constructor looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
    val width: Int = width
    val height: Int = height
    val area: Int = width * height
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="property-declarations">Property declarations</h5>
<p>You can put simple <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a property declaration is a way to define properties in a class or object, where the property is controlled by a provided delegate instead of having its own field. | This allows for shared functionality between similar properties. The syntax for declaring a delegated property is `var/val &lt;propertyName&gt;: &lt;PropertyType&gt; by &lt;delegate&gt;`. The delegate must provide a `getValue` function (and `setValue` function for `var`) that performs the getting and setting operations for the property. This mechanism enables properties to be backed by something other than a class field, such as a map, improving code readability and programming experience.">property declarations</a> <strong>inside </strong>the primary constructor. To declare a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a read-only property is a property that can only be read and not modified. | It is achieved by using the `val` keyword instead of `var` when declaring the property. The `val` keyword indicates that the property is immutable and can only be assigned a value once during initialization. This helps ensure the integrity of the data and prevent unintended modification. Additionally, read-only properties can be used to expose internal state in a safe and controlled manner, without allowing external code to modify it.">read-only property</a>, put the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> in the parentheses before the argument name. For a mutable property, use the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">var</code>.</p>
<p>For example, let's move the property <code class="language-kotlin">width</code> from the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class body refers to the section of a class declaration that contains the class members, such as properties, methods, and inner classes. | It is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and appears immediately following the class name and any visibility modifiers. The class body can be empty, as in the case of a marker interface, or it can contain a variety of member declarations.">class body</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, height: Int) {
    val height: Int = height
    val area: Int = width * height
}</code></pre>
<p>Now let's put the remaining property <code class="language-kotlin">height</code> inside the primary constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
    val area: Int = width * height
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="default-and-named-arguments">Default and named arguments</h5>
<p>Default values in primary constructors are set in the same way as in the class body. You declare the property with a keyword <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> and place the default value after the assignment operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(var width: Int = 1, var height: Int = 1) {
    val area: Int = width * height
}</code></pre>
<p>When creating an object of a class with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a default value is a preassigned value for a function parameter, which means that you can invoke the function without explicitly providing a value for that parameter, and the default value will be used instead. | This capability allows for more concise function calls when not all arguments need to be specified. Default values are noted in the function declaration using the `=` operator after the type, and can be overridden by providing a named argument when invoking the function.">default values</a> in the primary constructor, you can use the default values by omitting the arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size = Size() // width == 1, height == 1</code></pre>
<p>You can either provide values without property names or use <strong>named arguments</strong> when creating instances of a class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size1 = Size(3, 5) // width == 3, height == 5
val size2 = Size(width = 3, height = 5) // width == 3, height == 5
val size3 = Size(height = 5, width = 3) // width == 3, height == 5</code></pre>
<p>You can also omit some of the properties with default values when creating an object. Keep it in mind though, if you break the order of the arguments in the primary constructor, you should always use named arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sizeWide = Size(10) // width == 10, height == 1
val sizeHigh = Size(height = 10) // width == 1, height == 10</code></pre>
<p>A primary constructor is a handy way to define a class concisely. If you want to avoid redundant lines of code, try to make use of primary constructors and default arguments.</p>
<h5 id="single-line-classes">Single line classes</h5>
<p>If there are no other class members left except the ones in the primary constructor, we can omit empty curly braces. Imagine that the <code class="language-kotlin">area</code> property is missing in our example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int)</code></pre>
<p>You can see such classes frequently in real life. For example, <strong>data classes</strong>—classes whose main utility is storing data—are defined in this way. You will learn about them later on.</p>
<h5 id="init">Init</h5>
<p>Primary constructors cannot contain any code: they only set the values of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class property represents data within an object and controls how this data is accessed and manipulated. | It is a mechanism to encapsulate data within our object and differs from a method, which performs a certain operation. A property holds state or data, while a method contains logic. Property overriding is a feature in Kotlin that allows you to modify the behavior or value of a property in a derived class, providing a new layer of flexibility. You can define a property in a base class and then override it in a derived class, extending a single property. This results in more efficient operations, as dereferencing an object is avoided. Additionally, inline classes can benefit from CPU cache optimization due to their reduced size. However, inline classes should be used judiciously, as overuse or inappropriate use can lead to code that is harder to maintain or understand. Property in Kotlin takes the place of fields seen in other languages, such as Java, and provides a way to encapsulate data within an object and control how that data is accessed and manipulated.">class properties</a> based on the passed arguments. Sometimes, we want to set some of our properties based on other properties' values or other sources of information. In such cases, we would use <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an initializer block is a block of code prefixed with the `init` keyword that serves as an extension of the primary constructor. | It is used to set the values of class properties based on other property values or other sources of information, as the primary constructor can only set property values based on passed arguments. There can be multiple initializer blocks in a class body, and they are executed in the order of their appearance. It's a useful coding convention to use a parameter name that begins with an underscore to distinguish it from class members.">initializer blocks</a></strong>, which are prefixed with the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">init</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    init {
        width = if (_width &gt;= 0) _width else {
            println("Error, the width should be a non-negative value")
            0
        }
        height = if (_height &gt;= 0) _height else {
            println("Error, the height should be a non-negative value")
            0
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code class="language-kotlin">init</code> signifies a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a block of code is a group of zero or more statements enclosed in a pair of curly braces. | It is a fundamental part of the language's syntax and can be used in various contexts such as function bodies, control structures, and exception handling. Blocks can contain any number of statements, and they allow for the grouping and organization of code. For example, when handling exceptions in Kotlin, you can use a block to specify the code to be executed when an exception occurs.">block of code</a> that serves as an extension of the primary constructor. For example, the code below prints a message after the object properties have been set in the primary constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
    init {
        println("Initializer block that prints the width ($width) and the height ($height)")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>There may be several initializer blocks in the class body. In this case, property initializers and <code class="language-kotlin">init</code> blocks are executed in the order of their appearance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
    // 1: the width property is initialized
    val width = _width

    // 2: 1st init block is executed
    init {
        println("First initializer block that prints the width $width")
    }

    // 3: the height property is initialized
    val height = _height

    // 4: 2nd init block is executed
    init {
        println("Second initializer block that prints the height $height")
    }

    // 5: the area property is initialized
    val area = width * height
}</code></pre>
<p>In the examples above, the parameter names begin with underscores (<code class="language-kotlin">_width</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">_height</code>) to distinguish them from class members (<code class="language-kotlin">width</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">height</code>). It is a useful coding convention widely accepted in various programming languages.</p>
