<p>You already know how to work with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a primary constructor is a special type of constructor that is declared as part of the class header, after the class name. | It can have parameters that are used to initialize class properties directly or within an initializer block. The primary constructor cannot contain any code, but initialization code can be placed in initializer blocks. If a class requires more complex initialization that cannot be covered by the primary constructor, secondary constructors can be used. These secondary constructors must delegate to the primary constructor either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor.">primary constructors</a>. However, they have their limitations. For example, you may need to create several different constructors for the same class, but you can't do that with a primary constructor alone. That's where secondary, or custom, constructors come in handy.</p>
<h5 id="custom-constructor">Custom constructor</h5>
<p>You can declare <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a custom constructor is a specialized method that is used to initialize the properties of a class. | It is declared within the class body and has its own parameter list. Unlike primary constructors, custom constructors allow you to create multiple constructors for the same class, each with its own logic for initializing the class properties. This is useful when you need to create several different instances of a class with varying initial values.">custom constructors</a></strong> for a class along with a primary constructor or without one.</p>
<p>To declare a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a secondary constructor is an additional constructor that can be defined in a class, along with a primary constructor. | They are used when the primary constructor is not sufficient or when you need to perform extra initialization steps. Secondary constructors are defined within the class body using the `constructor` keyword, followed by parentheses containing the constructor's parameters. They provide more flexibility than primary constructors, but they require explicit delegation to the primary constructor. The base class's constructor must be completed before the secondary constructor's body is executed.">secondary constructor</a>, write the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include `fun` (used to define a function), `var` (used to define a variable), and `if` (used to define a conditional statement). Keywords are reserved words in Kotlin and cannot be used as identifiers.">keyword</a> <code class="language-kotlin">constructor</code> inside the class body and parentheses with the constructor's parameters after the keyword. Then, put curly braces with the constructor logic inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you can create objects in one line, just as if you were using a primary constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size1 = Size(3, 4)
val size2 = Size(5, 1)</code></pre>
<p>Be careful: you have to either use an implicit constructor or declare your own, but you cannot use both at the same time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width

<p>What you can do is create a replica of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a default constructor is an implicitly generated constructor for a class that does not have any explicitly defined constructors. | It has no parameters and is used to create an object without initializing its properties. If a class has properties with default values, these values can be used when creating an object by omitting the corresponding arguments or using named arguments.

A primary constructor is a concise way to define a class and can help avoid redundant code.">default constructor</a> explicitly (empty curly braces can be removed):</p>

}</code></pre>
<h5 id="multiple-constructors">Multiple constructors</h5>
<p>Creating several constructors for a class is almost as simple as creating just one, but there is a particular constraint you need to keep in mind. Every secondary constructor has to have a unique signature. You cannot use the same signature for the primary or any other constructor.</p>
<p>The constructor signature consists of the number, the types, and the order of the parameters. To create a valid constructor, you need to make sure it has a unique list of parameters. As an example, look at the following constructors for the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_height: Int) {
        height = _height
    }

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Double) {
        width = _width
        height = _height.toInt()
    }

    constructor(_height: Double, _width: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height.toInt()
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The code below will create four <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> objects with the same property values using different constructors:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size1 = Size(7) // uses 1st constructor
val size2 = Size(0,7) // uses 2nd constructor
val size3 = Size(0, 7.0) // uses 3rd constructor
val size4 = Size(7.0, 0) // uses 4th constructor</code></pre>
<p>Remember that signatures are defined by the types of the parameters, not by their names. For example, the compiler can not tell these two constructors apart, even if they look different for a person:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {}
constructor(x: Int, y: Int) {}</code></pre>
<p>So, implemented in the same class, these constructors will cause an error.</p>
<h5 id="this-keyword"><code class="language-kotlin">this</code> keyword</h5>
<p>Inside the class code, you can also access the object members using a special keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> that represents the current object.</p>
<p>For example, you can use it to name the constructor parameters the same as the class properties. Let's change the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, you will get an error without the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code>, since the names will be interpreted as the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an immutable is a type of object or variable that, once initialized, cannot be changed. | This helps ensure the integrity of data and prevents unintended modifications. For example, a list of pages in a book may be an immutable collection, where the content cannot be altered over time. In contrast, a mutable collection allows for changes to be made, such as adding, removing, or updating stored items. Immutable variables, declared using the `val` keyword, are particularly useful for exposing internal state in a safe and controlled manner, as they cannot be modified by external code.">immutable</a> constructor parameters and not the class members.</p>
<h5 id="omitting-default-values">Omitting default values</h5>
<p>As you remember, if a property value is assigned in the constructor, you don't have to provide a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a default value is a preassigned value for a function parameter, which means that you can invoke the function without explicitly providing a value for that parameter, and the default value will be used instead. | This capability allows for more concise function calls when not all arguments need to be specified. Default values are noted in the function declaration using the `=` operator after the type, and can be overridden by providing a named argument when invoking the function.">default value</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size (var width: Int, var height: Int) {
    // whatever you want
}</code></pre>
<p>This is also true for the secondary constructor. Let's change <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> to <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> in the <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> class, so the properties cannot be reassigned. For the sake of demonstration, let's add another property <code class="language-kotlin">area</code> that will be calculated based on the constructor parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    val width: Int
    val height: Int
    val area: Int

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
        this.area = width * height
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It looks like a reassignment, but you are just initializing the values, so nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot use the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> keywords in the secondary constructor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    constructor(val width: Int, val height: Int) { // error, val is not allowed
    }
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="constructors-delegation">Constructors delegation</h5>
<p>If a class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to call the primary one, either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor(s). This is called <strong>delegation</strong>.</p>
<p>Delegation to another constructor of the same class is done with the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> placed after the constructor arguments and before the constructor body:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
    var area: Int = width * height

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int, outerSize: Size) : this(width, height) {
        outerSize.area -= this.area
        println("Updated outer object's area is equal to ${outerSize.area}")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Delegation to the primary constructor becomes the first statement of a secondary constructor, so the properties are initialized before the secondary constructor code is executed. Initializer blocks, if present, are also executed before the secondary constructor. If a class has no primary constructor, the delegation happens implicitly.</p>
<h5 id="constructor-execution">Constructor execution</h5>
<p>Let's look at the example and see in which order the class code is executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
    var area: Int = width * height

    init {
        println("Object with area equal to $area is created")
    }

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int, outerSize: Size) : this(width, height) {
        outerSize.area -= this.area
        println("Updated outer object's area is equal to ${outerSize.area}")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val outerObject = Size(5, 8)
    val innerObject = Size(2, 3, outerObject)
}</code></pre>
<p>When creating <code class="language-kotlin">outerObject</code>, the primary constructor is directly called, the properties are initialized and the <code class="language-kotlin">init</code> block is executed. In case of <code class="language-kotlin">innerObject</code>, the secondary constructor first calls the primary, the properties initialization and the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10746" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, initialization refers to the process of creating and allocating memory to an object. | Lazy initialization is a technique that allows the creation of an object to be delayed until it is actually needed, rather than at the time of declaration. This is particularly useful for more complex classes, as it saves time and resources by not immediately allocating memory to objects that may not be required from the outset. By allowing objects to be initialized when they're needed, the allocation of resources can be redistributed over the life cycle of a program, leading to time savings. This can be achieved in different ways in different languages and frameworks.">initialization</a> block happen, and finally, the secondary constructor code is executed.</p>
<p>It results in the following output:</p>

Object with area equal to 6 is created
Updated outer object's area is equal to 34</code></pre>
