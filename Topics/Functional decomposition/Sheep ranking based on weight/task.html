<p>A farmer wants to allocate ranks to his sheep based on their weight. He wants the fatter sheep to have lower ranks, and the thinner ones to have higher ranks. He has sorted out the weights of his sheep and now needs your help. Create a program in Kotlin that takes the weight of the sheep as input and gives it a rank based on its weight. The ranking rules are as follows: - Weight less than 30, rank 1 - Weight between 30 (inclusive) and 50, rank 2 - Weight between 50 (inclusive) and 70, rank 3 - Weight equal to or more than 70, rank 4</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">25<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1<br></code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">30<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
