<p>When programmers implement an object-oriented program, they often use already defined classes to build it. For example, an object of the <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> class allows you to get the next word from the console input, and this word is itself an object of the <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> class. Nevertheless, programmers still often need to declare some program-specific classes. In this topic, we will discuss several ways of creating and using your own simple class.</p>
<h5 id="declaring-new-classes">Declaring new classes</h5>
<p>In order to declare a new class, you need to write the <code class="language-kotlin">class</code> keyword and the <strong>class name</strong> after it. First, let's declare a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class name is a unique identifier for a class, which is used to declare a new class or create an object of that class. | It is specified in the class header, followed by the class body enclosed in curly braces. The class name can be used to access class members, such as properties or methods, by using a dot and the property or method name. A class name can also be used to create an instance of the class using the object creation syntax, followed by empty parentheses. Additionally, a class name can be used to declare a companion object, which allows for storing data and implementing class-wide functionality.">class named</a> <code class="language-kotlin">Emptiness</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Emptiness {
    // empty body
}</code></pre>
<p>In Kotlin, when a class has an <strong>empty body</strong>, <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, curly braces `{}` are used to denote a block of code, which can contain zero or more statements. | They are also used in string templates to evaluate complex expressions or object properties. If the expression is more complex, curly braces can be used around the expression following the dollar sign `$`. It is a good practice to always use curly braces for expressions in string templates to avoid mistakes and improve code readability.">curly braces</a></strong> can be <strong>omitted</strong>. So the same class can be defined in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Emptiness</code></pre>
<p>You can declare classes in <code class="language-kotlin">.kt</code> files. Usually, it's better to declare them at the top level of a file but you can declare them in other places, even inside a function.</p>
<h5 id="object-creation">Object creation</h5>
<p>What's the purpose of declaring a class? Well, simply speaking, each defined <strong>class</strong> introduces a <strong>new type</strong>. So you can create objects of a class and store them as variables and values. Sometimes standard types are not enough, so this comes in handy. There will be a few examples later on to make it clear.</p>
<p>To create an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an instance refers to an object or an instance of a class that is created during runtime. | It is a subtype of every known type in Kotlin, meaning it can represent a value of any type in terms of type checking. This is particularly useful in situations where a function demands a return type, but it is impossible to return a value, such as when calculating a percentage if the value is zero. In such cases, a function that returns `Instance` can be used. The concept of instance is also related to threading, where only one thread can execute code in a synchronized method of a particular instance. This means that different threads can execute methods of different objects at the same time, a concept that can be summarized as one thread per instance.">instance</a> of a class, simply write the <strong>class name</strong> and <strong>empty parentheses</strong>. In other words, the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a syntax refers to the set of rules and conventions that dictate how a program should be written in the language. | It includes the structure of statements, expressions, and keywords, as well as the use of indentation, whitespace, and comments. An expression, for example, is a type of syntax that evaluates to a single value, such as a literal value, variable, function call, or a combination of these elements using operators. Understanding the syntax of Kotlin is essential for writing clear, maintainable, and error-free code.">syntax</a> is similar to calling a function. For example, let's do that for the <code class="language-kotlin">Emptiness</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val empty: Emptiness = Emptiness()</code></pre>
<p>We have just assigned a new object of the <code class="language-kotlin">Emptiness</code> class to the <code class="language-kotlin">empty</code> variable. This variable has the <code class="language-kotlin">Emptiness</code> type so you can't reassign an object of any other type to it. As a general rule in Kotlin the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an explicit type is a data type that is explicitly defined for a variable or value at compile time. | Because Kotlin is a statically-typed language, it requires explicit type conversion when switching a value from one data type to another. Implicit type conversion is not allowed in Kotlin to avoid precision loss or unforeseen outcomes. When converting a variable from one type to another, explicit conversion methods such as toInt(), toDouble(), etc. must be used. This ensures type safety and prevents undesirable outcomes. Explicitly defining types in Kotlin enhances code clarity, optimizes performance, and improves overall code trustworthiness.">explicit type</a> directive can be omitted:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val empty = Emptiness()</code></pre>
<h5 id="class-member">Class member</h5>
<p>A <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class body refers to the section of a class declaration that contains the class members, such as properties, methods, and inner classes. | It is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and appears immediately following the class name and any visibility modifiers. The class body can be empty, as in the case of a marker interface, or it can contain a variety of member declarations.">class body</a> can include <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class member is a component that belongs to a class and can be either a property or a function. | Class members can be accessed and used within the class they belong to. When it comes to functions, member functions are functions that are defined within a class and can access the class's fields. They are also called methods and are used to implement a common behavior for a set of objects that belong to the same class. Class members can also be nested classes, which are classes defined within another class. Inner classes, a type of nested class, can access the members of their outer class, while regular nested classes cannot.">class members</a></strong>. For now, we will discuss only <strong>properties</strong> that replace <strong>fields</strong> in Kotlin: they can <strong>store data</strong>, too. We will discuss other advantages of properties and other class members in further topics.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that all class members are optional. For example, the <code class="language-kotlin">Emptiness</code> class has no properties.</p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="writing-properties">Writing properties</h5>
<p>Properties are pretty similar to variables and values. If you want to assign a value to a property during runtime, you declare it as a <code class="language-kotlin">var</code>, otherwise, a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> is your choice.</p>
<p>Also, any property has a strict type. It can be a standard type, like a number or a string, or a custom type. So a property type can be your own class and even the same class where the property is declared.</p>
<p>A property that just stores data must somehow receive an <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6200" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an initial value is a value that is assigned to a variable when it is declared and initialized. | When you declare a variable with the `val` keyword, it is read-only, meaning its value cannot be changed after it has been initialized. The initial value can be a literal value, a constant, a function call, or any other expression that returns a value. It is important to note that if you declare a variable with the `var` keyword, it is mutable and its value can be changed after it has been initialized. When declaring a variable with an initial value, you can use the `=` symbol followed by the value. This creates an object, but it is not necessarily resource- or time-consuming for the compiler. However, creating instances of more complex classes can be expensive. To tackle this issue, you can use lazy initialization, which creates an object at the exact point when the first reference to it occurs. This means that you don't need to waste time by immediately using your program's resources to allocate memory to objects that are not required from the outset. In summary, an initial value in Kotlin is a value that is assigned to a variable when it is declared and initialized. When using the `val` keyword, the variable is read-only and its value cannot be changed after initialization.">initial value</a></strong>. For example, you can set the property in the class body.</p>
<p>A class can have as many properties as you need.</p>
<p>Now let's declare a class for representing a patient in a hospital information system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Patient {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
    var age: Int = 0
    var height: Double = 0.0
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we see that the <code class="language-kotlin">Patient</code> class has three properties that you can reassign: name, age, and height.</p>
<p>Each object of the class has the <strong>same set of fields</strong>, but the <strong>values</strong> of the fields <strong>can differ</strong> from object to object.</p>
<h5 id="accessing-properties">Accessing properties</h5>
<p>Now we will learn how to access object properties. First, we need to create an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var patient = Patient()</code></pre>
<p>We haven't changed the object properties yet, so they have initial values now. To get those properties' values, type in <strong>a dot and the property name</strong> after the object name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(patient.name) // prints "Unknown"
println(patient.age)  // prints "0"</code></pre>
<h5 id="changing-properties">Changing properties</h5>
<p>Take a look at the example below. This program creates two patients and sets their properties, then prints them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Patient {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
    var age: Int = 0
    var height: Double = 0.0
}

fun main() {
    val john = Patient()
    john.name = "John"
    john.age = 30
    john.height = 180.0

    val alice = Patient()
    alice.name = "Alice"
    alice.age = 22
    alice.height = 165.0

    println("${john.name}: ${john.age} yrs, ${john.height} cm")
    println("${alice.name}: ${alice.age} yrs, ${alice.height} cm")
}</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">John: 30 yrs, 180.0 cm
Alice: 22 yrs, 165.0 cm</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Pay attention that when we assign properties of Alice, the properties of John remain unchanged.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Also, you need to understand that the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> before <code class="language-kotlin">alice</code> means that we can't reassign a <code class="language-kotlin">Patient</code> to <code class="language-kotlin">alice</code>. But we can reassign properties of <code class="language-kotlin">alice</code> because they are marked as <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> inside the <code class="language-kotlin">Patient</code> class.</p>
